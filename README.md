## Overview

Welcome to SignLink! SignLink helps people with difficulty in hearing or speaking to be able to communicate better. It uses subtitles and voice-overs to bridge the gap between sign language users (over 70 million worldwide) and those affected by hearing loss (1.5+ billion people globally). Our mission is to revolutionize communication so that everyone can be included and nobody is left behind. Find more details in the [SignLink documentation](https://rajtilakjee.github.io/SignLink/).
